# Bachelor-Project (Worked on it alone)

# Abstract
Goals without paths and well-known directions are just dreams. So knowing the direction
and the position of a specific object is truly important, as you will have a clear vision
about that object and how to deal with it. In this paper, I will argue how to estimate
the light directivity at a certain place and how to get the overall average intensity of
the light in it. By knowing the directivity and the intensity of light you will be able
to determine where the shadows are and which of those places will be darker or lighter
than the others. In photography, this is very useful, as it allows photographers and
movie-makers to adjust their camerasâ€™ positions, so they can capture the clearest image.
Moreover, it allows us to determine the position of any light source even if it is moving
and not fixed at a certain position. Last but not least, the most amazing and interesting
part of the project is allowing us to apply it on any other waveform other than the light
wave. For simplicity, the idea of the project is applicable to be applied on any shape of
waves that can traverse and it will determine the position of its source and calculate the
overall average intensity at this location. We can achieve this by replacing those light
sensors with the suitable sensors of that field; like sound sensors, heat sensors, infrared
sensors and in communication systems between transmitters and receivers. The idea of
estimation of light directivity goes as the following: let the light sensors read the light
intensity at your location and transmit it to a microcontroller which is called Arduino so
it can analyze it. The microcontroller shares the output results as a text message on a
screen connected to it through a breadboard and wires and also as a voice message played
by a smartphone connected to it using Bluetooth.

# Estimation of Light Intensity and Directivity

Estimation of light intensity and its directivity plays a crucial role in many fields nowadays. Due to the growing demands of science and technology of our daily life, the light became an essential element in many fields and attracted much attention to exploring its unrevealed benefits. Light intensity and directivity estimation are one of the most challenging problems recently in Computer Vision, Photography, Photo-chemical Reactions, Solar Systems. This paper presents a real hardware model that can detect and estimate the direction of the out-coming light from a fixed or a moving light source and calculate the overall average intensity of the light in that place.
