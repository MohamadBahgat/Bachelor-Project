# Bachelor-Project (Worked on it alone)


# Abstract
Goals without paths and well-known directions are just dreams. So knowing the direction
and the position of a specific object is truly important, as you will have a clear vision
about that object and how to deal with it. In this paper, I will argue how to estimate
the light directivity at a certain place and how to get the overall average intensity of
the light in it. By knowing the directivity and the intensity of light you will be able
to determine where the shadows are and which of those places will be darker or lighter
than the others. In photography, this is very useful, as it allows photographers and
movie-makers to adjust their cameras’ positions, so they can capture the clearest image.
Moreover, it allows us to determine the position of any light source even if it is moving
and not fixed at a certain position. Last but not least, the most amazing and interesting
part of the project is allowing us to apply it on any other waveform other than the light
wave. For simplicity, the idea of the project is applicable to be applied on any shape of
waves that can traverse and it will determine the position of its source and calculate the
overall average intensity at this location. We can achieve this by replacing those light
sensors with the suitable sensors of that field; like sound sensors, heat sensors, infrared
sensors and in communication systems between transmitters and receivers. The idea of
estimation of light directivity goes as the following: let the light sensors read the light
intensity at your location and transmit it to a microcontroller which is called Arduino so
it can analyze it. The microcontroller shares the output results as a text message on a
screen connected to it through a breadboard and wires and also as a voice message played
by a smartphone connected to it using Bluetooth.


# Estimation of Light Intensity and Directivity

Estimation of light intensity and its directivity plays a crucial role in many fields nowadays. Due to the growing demands of science and technology of our daily life, the light became an essential element in many fields and attracted much attention to exploring its unrevealed benefits. Light intensity and directivity estimation are one of the most challenging problems recently in Computer Vision, Photography, Photo-chemical Reactions, Solar Systems. This paper presents a real hardware model that can detect and estimate the direction of the out-coming light from a fixed or a moving light source and calculate the overall average intensity of the light in that place.


# Background

We can divide the project into two parts; Hardware and Software. The hardware part that
is responsible for any physical connections between devices and choosing the appropriate
components from hardware devices that will help us to get what we want from light
intensity and light directivity such as sensors. While the software part is responsible for
installing the suitable apps on the PC and the smartphone and writing the code that
would be burned on the microprocessor chip of the Arduino board.


# Summary

Light intensity and directivity estimation are one of the most challenging problems recently in Computer Vision, Photography, Photo-chemical Reactions, Solar Systems. By knowing the directivity and the intensity of light you will be able to determine where
the shadows are and which of those places will be darker or lighter than the others. In
photography, this is very useful, as it allows photographers and movie-makers to adjust
their cameras’ positions, so they can capture the clearest image. Moreover, it allows us to
determine the position of any light source even if it is moving and not fixed at a certain
position.

The project consists of two parts; Hardware and Software. The hardware part that
is responsible for any physical connections between devices and choosing the appropriate
components from hardware devices that will help us to get what we want from light
intensity and light directivity such as sensors. While the software part is responsible for
installing the suitable apps on the PC and the smartphone and writing the code that
would be burned on the microprocessor chip of the Arduino board.


# Limitations

This module is working perfectly with 1 single light source. It gets for you the exact
direction of your incoming light which means it gets also the location of your light source
pulse the overall average intensity at your location. The limitation of this module is when
you have multiple light sources. This module was designed only for one single light source.
But what happens when you will have multiple light sources and what will be the output
results? The overall average intensity will be calculated estimated perfectly without any
errors. But the direction of the light source that will be considered by the module is the
strongest of them. i.e. The direction that will have the largest light intensity that will
be read by the LDR sensors. That case was not required to be achieved in this project
but for the scientific secretariat, it is a limitation on this module to help those who will
continue working on my module in the future.


# Future Works

We can enlarge the idea of this module so it can deal with multiple light sources and not
just single. I have though about it deeply and reached that hardware components will stay as it is, we will only try to change the code somehow with more conditions in order to narrow down the choices for our module.

As I mentioned in the previous parts, how much this topic is important and extremely
helpful in different fields, it can be taken as it is without any single change in it and be
used. It will get the exact light intensity in the location and will estimate for you the
direction of the incoming light.
I have mentioned also, that this project idea and code can be taken and used in
different fields other than the light field. The only thing that is needed is to replace those
LDR sensors with the suitable sensors of your field such as sound sensors, heat sensors,
infrared sensors and in communication systems between transmitters and receivers and
wait for the amazing results.
